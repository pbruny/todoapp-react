## The project

This project was made following [this tutorial](https://onebitcode.com/crud-com-rails-e-react/). Only the client using react was replicated. Also, an online todo API that [you can use here](https://github.com/iago-silva/todos-api) was used to fetch data and make CRUD operations work.
